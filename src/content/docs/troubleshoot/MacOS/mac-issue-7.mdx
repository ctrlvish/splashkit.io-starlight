### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'splashkit' in Python`

**Description:** This guide helps resolve the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'splashkit' in Python` on MacOS. This issue occurs when Python is installed through Homebrew and the SplashKit path is not correctly set in the `.zshrc` file where the Homebrew version of Python is present.

---

## Problem

MacOS prioritises its built-in Python installation located in `/usr/bin/python3`. SplashKit and other dependencies are installed in the Python environment managed by Homebrew, which is located at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` or similar paths. Due to this, the SplashKit module cannot be located in shell’s environment variables (`PATH`).

## Solution

To resolve this, add this line: `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` to your `.zshrc` file. Follow the steps below:

<Steps>

1. **Locate Your `.zshrc` File**

   The `.zshrc` file is located in your home directory at `~/Users/(your username)/`.

   If you don’t see it, press **Shift + Command + . (dot)** to toggle hidden files visibility in Finder.

2. **Identify Your Username (Optional)**

   To ensure you’re in the correct directory, you can use the `whoami` command in Terminal to check your username:

   ```shell
   whoami
   ```

3. **Add SplashKit to PATH**

   To ensure macOS uses the Homebrew-installed version of Python, open the `.zshrc` file with a text editor and add the following line at the start to include the SplashKit path:

   ```shell
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
   ```

4. **Apply Changes**

   Save the `.zshrc` file and then reload it with the following command to apply changes immediately:

   ```shell
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. **Check Python version**

   Verify that the terminal is using the Homebrew-installed Python version:

   ```shell
   which python3
   ```

   The output should be something like:

   ```shell
   /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
   ```

6. **Test the setup**

   Run your Python script again. It should now successfully locate the SplashKit module.

</Steps>

After completing these steps, your terminal will use the Homebrew-installed version of Python, and your Python script should now successfully find and run the SplashKit module without encountering the `ModuleNotFoundError`.
